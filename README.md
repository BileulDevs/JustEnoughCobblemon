# Just Enough Cobblemon

**Just Enough Cobblemon** is a lightweight utility addon for [Cobblemon](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cobblemon). It provides seamless integration with **Just Enough Items (JEI)** / **EMI** to help players discover Pokémon loot, and adds a dedicated **Spawn** tab directly inside the Pokédex. Server installation is optional, but required if you want to access spawn data on a multiplayer server.
